    "content": "# The Art of Attar: A Quiet History\n\nAttar (also written *ittar*) is among the most refined forms of perfumery to emerge from the Indian subcontinent. Unlike alcohol-based sprays, attars are concentrated fragrant oils—often crafted through slow distillation and matured for harmony rather than volume.\n\n## Deg–Bhapka: Distillation as discipline\n\nTraditional attar making is anchored in the **deg–bhapka** system: a copper still (*deg*) and a receiver (*bhapka*), joined by a bamboo tube. Heat is applied gently. Vapours travel. Fragrance is collected—not forced.\n\n> The finest perfumery is not loud. It is accurate.\n\n## Attar as sacred adornment\n\nAcross temples and homes, fragrance has long been a quiet companion to prayer: flowers offered, incense lit, sandalwood applied. Attar sits within this lineage—intimate, skin-close, and respectful.\n\n### How to wear attar today\n\n- Apply a pin-drop to pulse points.\n- Give it two minutes—then stop checking it.\n- Let warmth reveal the heart and base over hours.\n\n## Care & storage\n\nAttars reward stillness. Keep the bottle away from heat and direct sun. Close the cap firmly. With time, the sharp edges soften and the composition becomes more seamless.\n\n### References\n\n- Kannauj perfumery traditions and oral histories\n- Deg–bhapka distillation practices (artisan interviews)\n"

    "content": "# Zodiac & Fragrance: A Minimal Guide\n\nAstrology is best approached as *symbolic weather*, not a rigid instruction set. With attar, the goal is similar: find the note families that support your day.\n\n## Think in elements\n\n- **Fire** signs often enjoy spice, amber, bright florals.\n- **Earth** signs tend to settle into woods, vetiver, resins.\n- **Air** signs lean toward green, clean musks, modern clarity.\n- **Water** signs may love soft florals, incense, skin musks.\n\n## A gentle method\n\n1. Choose one family for mornings.\n2. Choose one family for evenings.\n3. Repeat for 14 days.\n\nThis is how fragrance becomes memory.\n\n## Planetary mood cues\n\n- **Venus**: grace and harmony (rose, soft amber)\n- **Saturn**: discipline and structure (vetiver, woods)\n- **Moon**: calm mind (jasmine, powder, clean musk)\n\n### Closing note\n\nWear the attar that helps you behave like yourself—quietly, consistently.\n"

    "content": "# How to Store Attar (and Make It Last)\n\nAttar is concentrated and often more stable than alcohol sprays, but it is still made of volatile aromatics. Storage is not superstition; it’s chemistry.\n\n## The three enemies\n\n1. **Heat** (accelerates oxidation)\n2. **Light** (degrades delicate top notes)\n3. **Air** (introduces oxygen and moisture)\n\n## A simple storage ritual\n\n- Keep the bottle in a drawer or box.\n- Close the cap firmly after use.\n- Avoid storing in bathrooms or window shelves.\n\n## What “aging” means\n\nAging is the slow settling of a blend: sharper notes soften, materials integrate, and the overall contour becomes smoother.\n\n### When to worry\n\nIf the attar smells sharply rancid, sour, or unusually “flat,” it may have been stored poorly. In most cases, good storage restores harmony over time.\n"
